# ESP32-LED-Control-with-Flutter
The sole purpose of this project was for me to learn Flutter and how it can communicate with a Microcontroller.
## Installation
DISCLAIMER: I've only tested this on an ESP-WROOM-32 and an android phone. It may not work on other devices. Additionally, I haven't done any of the security checks and signatures required to upload the app to the play store. If you attempt to install it, your phone will try to dissuade you from installing the app.

If you're insterested in trying it out with the devices it's been tested on, you'll need to install the [APK](https://github.com/banana-galaxy/ESP32-LED-Control-with-Flutter/blob/main/flutter/build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-arm64-v8a-release.apk) on your android device and upload the [code](https://github.com/banana-galaxy/ESP32-LED-Control-with-Flutter/blob/main/ESP32/src/main.cpp) to your ESP-WROOM-32.
